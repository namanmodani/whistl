# whistl - The Community Accessibility Bulletin

## Why?

Roughly [15% of UCLA students reported having some type of disability](https://sairo.ucla.edu/file/4317cf06-d7d3-4464-95f6-dde3786e7820).
Given that there are [~31,600 undergraduate students](https://www.ucla.edu/about/facts-and-figures) on campus, this translates to nearly 5,000 - a substantial number of - students having a disability. We wanted to create an app that empowered differently-abled people to thrive better.

## How?

Sure, UCLA has the [best college campus in the nation](https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-college-campuses/). But it isn't perfect. Every now and then, we come across out-of-order elevators, damaged pavements, incorrectly-placed stop signs, poor lighting, lack of cross and other issues that affect the ability of differently-abled persons to navigate campus.

So, creating a platform that allows members of the UCLA community to draw attention to these issues is one step towards making UCLA a more inclusive community.

## What?

Firstly, we put together prototypes of our app in Figma. We then developed a **mobile-responsive web app** on the React framework, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

For our backend, we utilized BaaS Google Firebase, since this provided us with convenient authentication, databases, hosting, and analytics all in one place.

We also created optimized **WebView apps natively for both Android (Java) and iOS (Swift)**.
