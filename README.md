whistl - The Community Accessibility Bulletin

## Why?

Roughly 15% of UCLA students reported having some type of disability. [Source.](https://sairo.ucla.edu/file/4317cf06-d7d3-4464-95f6-dde3786e7820)
Given that there are [~31,600 undergraduate students](https://www.ucla.edu/about/facts-and-figures) on campus, this translates to nearly 5,000 - a substantial number of - students having a disability. We wanted to create an app that empowered differently-abled people to thrive better.

## How?

Sure, UCLA has the [best college campus in the nation](https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-college-campuses/). But it isn't perfect. Every now and then, we come across out-of-order elevators, damaged pavements, incorrectly-placed stop signs, poor lighting, lack of cross and other issues that affect the ability of differently-abled persons to navigate campus.

So, creating a platform that allows members of the UCLA community to draw attention to these issues is one step towards making UCLA a more inclusive community.
